"""
Purpose: Shared traffic-light preflight probes for the dashboard.
Author: Mike Hallett (with Claude Code)
Date: 2026-05-15
Input: Filesystem paths and remote host objects.
Output: ``Probe`` records that the UI renders as green/yellow/red rows.

A probe is a single check: did the folder exist, can we ssh, did the
GitHub repo exist? Each probe carries a ``status`` (``ok`` /
``warn`` / ``fail``), human-readable ``detail``, and a ``required``
flag the UI uses to decide whether to block the overall action.

Two callers today: ``POST /api/machine/settings`` (wigamig_base
subfolder creation + Obsidian vault check) and the project-approve /
workspace-initialize endpoints (repo create, collaborator sync, host
probes). Keeping the dataclass and helpers in one place means every
panel can show the same status pill style.
